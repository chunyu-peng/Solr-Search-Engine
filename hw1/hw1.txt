The search engine I use is Ask. Compared with Google over all queries, the average percent overlap is 32.2% and the average Spearman coefficient is -7.04602381.
The overlapping rate is not high, so results of these two search engines are mostly distinct from each other.
The coefficient is negative, which means the rank results of Ask is dissimilar to the rank of Google.
Therefore, these two search engines did apply different searching algorithms.
I will say Google is better than Ask, as Google ranks its search results by popularity, and popular results are what I need for most of times.
